# WLED

WLED is connected to Hyperion by selecting the "Controller type" als WLED and entering the IP-Adress of your WLED instance in the Hyperion UI.\
Hyperion uses the brightness setting set in WLED. E.g. if you set the brightness in WLED to 10% the LEDs will light up to a maximum of 10%. If you would like Hyperion to override the brightness setting of WLED and use the maximum brightness you can do so by going to the WLED configuration -> Sync. Settings and enabling "Force max brightness".
